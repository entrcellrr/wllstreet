#wallstreet_doc

This is the main documentation of the Wall Street Module

Here are some basic recommendations:

1)All the programmers that are comitted to the Wall Street Project will create a seperate branch, and only when they have debugged and verified the code will they sync or publish it.
2)Use the whole text for identifiers and/or very understable Abbreviations.
3)They can change this documentation as much as they want, however they should put the timings and stamps.
